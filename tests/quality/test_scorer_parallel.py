"""Tests for QualityScorer parallel execution and weight_config integration.

Note: pytest.ini sets asyncio_mode = auto, so async test methods do not
require @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators.

Work Package B / WPB-3 — covers:
  - ThreadPoolExecutor creation and shutdown
  - _evaluate_category_sync() correctness and thread isolation
  - max_workers parameter propagation
  - evaluate() uses executor (submission path)
  - weight_config parameter and metadata recording
