"""
GAIA Project Orchestration Kernel

Provides project-level orchestration on top of PipelineEngine:
- Objective-driven task management via .gaia/objectives.yaml
- Dependency-aware scheduling (circular dependency detection, cascade execution)
- Hook integration on a dedicated orchestrator HookRegistry
- Git-aware commit/PR workflows with auto_commit=False default
- NexusService integration for unified state tracking

Example:
    >>> from gaia.orchestration import ProjectOrchestrator
    >>> orchestrator = ProjectOrchestrator()
    >>> await orchestrator.run()
