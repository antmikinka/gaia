## Detailed Findings

### P1-1: Resilience Wiring in RoutingEngine

**File:** `src/gaia/pipeline/routing_engine.py`

#### What Was Changed
- Added imports: `CircuitBreaker`, `Bulkhead`, `RetryConfig`, `retry` from `gaia.resilience`
- Added instance-level resilience primitives in `__init__`:
  - `_routing_circuit_breaker`: CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30)
  - `_routing_bulkhead`: Bulkhead(max_concurrency=10, acquire_timeout=5.0)
  - `_routing_retry_config`: RetryConfig(max_retries=3, base_delay=1.0, max_delay=10.0)
- New method: `route_defect_resilient()` - wraps routing with full resilience stack
- New helper: `_make_resilient_route()` - creates retry-wrapped callable

#### Bugs Found (ALL FIXED)

**BUG #1: Incorrect resilience stacking (MEDIUM) — FIXED**

The lambda was calling `_make_resilient_route()` inside the lambda body, creating new wrappers on each invocation. Fixed by pre-building the callable before passing to circuit breaker:

```python
route_callable = self._make_resilient_route(defect, context)
return self._routing_circuit_breaker.call(
    lambda: self._routing_bulkhead.execute(route_callable)
)
```

**BUG #2: Missing blank line (PEP 8 violation) (LOW) — FIXED**

Added proper two blank lines between `_make_resilient_route()` and `route_defects()` methods.

---

#### Positive Findings
- Backward compatibility maintained: `route_defect()` unchanged
- Resilience primitives properly initialized in `__init__`
- Configuration values are reasonable (failure_threshold=5, max_concurrency=10, max_retries=3)
- Import structure correct - no circular dependencies introduced
- Type hints properly declared

---

### P1-2: Capability Vocabulary Migration

**File:** `util/migrate-capabilities.py`

#### Assessment: **PASS**

The migration script is well-implemented with:

**Strengths:**
- Dual-mode operation (dry-run by default, `--apply` for actual changes)
- Graceful fallback when PyYAML not available (string-based parsing)
- Comprehensive capability mapping (50+ mappings defined)
- Clear output showing what changed
- Safe handling of unknown capabilities (preserved as-is)

**Verification:**
- Script runs without errors
- Syntax check passes
- Migration already applied to `config/agents/security-auditor.yaml`:
  - `compliance-check` → `compliance-audit` (confirmed in git diff)

**Note:** The git diff shows the migration has already been applied. The dry-run now shows 0 changes because:
1. `compliance-check` → `compliance-audit` already applied to security-auditor.yaml
2. Other files either already use unified vocabulary or don't have legacy capabilities

**Files verified:**
- `config/agents/security-auditor.yaml`: Contains `compliance-audit` (correct)
- `config/agents/senior-developer.yaml`: Contains `test-automation`, `code-refactoring` (correct)

**Minor Observation:**
- `config/agents/test-coverage-analyzer.yaml` line 48 has `testing` in metadata tags, not capabilities - this is correct and should not be migrated

### B3-C: Agent UI Pipeline SSE Endpoint

**File:** `src/gaia/ui/routers/pipeline.py`

#### Assessment: **PASS** (Bugs Fixed)

#### Issues Found (ALL FIXED)

**BUG #1: Lock release logic error in streaming path (MEDIUM) — FIXED**

The `locks_released` tracking variable was set prematurely (line 400), before the streaming generator started executing. This could cause double-release of the semaphore and race conditions on client disconnect.

**Fix Applied:** Removed `locks_released` tracking variable entirely. Locks are now always released in the `BackgroundTask(_release_locks)` for the streaming path, matching the simpler non-streaming pattern. The outer `finally` block is now a no-op for both paths.

**BUG #2: Generator exception handling (LOW) — FIXED**

`json.dumps()` calls in error paths were not protected, which could cause unhandled exceptions during error handling.

**Fix Applied:** All `json.dumps()` calls in the streaming generator are now wrapped in try/except blocks with safe fallback strings for serialization failures.

---

#### Positive Findings
- SSE endpoint properly implements streaming with `text/event-stream` media type
- Correct headers for SSE (`Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Connection: keep-alive`)
- Event types documented in docstring: `status`, `step`, `thinking`, `tool_start`, `tool_end`, `tool_result`, `done`, `error`
- Session lock prevents duplicate runs for same session
- Semaphore limits concurrent pipeline runs (max 5)
- Non-streaming path is clean and correct

## Regression Testing Checklist

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `route_defect()` backward compatibility | PASS | Method signature unchanged |
| Resilience module imports | PASS | All imports resolve correctly |
| Import cycle detection | PASS | No cycles introduced |
| Syntax validation | PASS | All files compile without errors |
| Migration script dry-run | PASS | Script executes without errors |
| Migration script syntax | PASS | No syntax errors |

## Section 9: Code Quality Verification for Merge (2026-04-11)

**Verifier:** Marcus Chen, Senior Software Developer

### 9.1 Files Verified

| File | Syntax | Logic | Locks | Serialization | Status |
|------|--------|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
| `src/gaia/ui/routers/pipeline.py` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | PASS |
| `src/gaia/pipeline/routing_engine.py` | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | PASS |
| `src/gaia/pipeline/orchestrator.py` | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | PASS |
| `src/gaia/agents/routing/agent.py` | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A | PASS |

### 9.2 SSE Endpoint Verification

**Lock Release (Lines 344-354, 419):**
- Session lock released in `BackgroundTask(_release_locks)` ✅
- Semaphore released in same BackgroundTask ✅
- No double-release risk (removed `locks_released` tracking) ✅

**JSON Serialization (Lines 360-368, 384-398, 401-409):**
- All `json.dumps()` calls wrapped in try/except ✅
- Safe fallback strings for serialization failures ✅

### 9.3 Resilience Stacking Verification

**Resilience Stack (Lines 520-537):**
- Pre-builds retry-wrapped callable (avoids recreation on each call) ✅
- Circuit breaker → bulkhead → retry → route_defect() ✅
- Configuration values reasonable (threshold=5, concurrency=10, retries=3) ✅

### 9.4 Pipeline Orchestrator Verification

**5-Stage Pipeline (Lines 14-20, 114-243):**
- Domain Analysis → Workflow Modeling → Loom Building → Gap Detection → Execution ✅
- Auto-spawn logic correct (Lines 198-209) ✅
- JSON parsing with fallback (Lines 479-510) ✅

### 9.5 RoutingAgent Default Assessment

**Finding:** RoutingAgent defaults to CodeAgent (Line 488)

**Impact:**
- CLI (`gaia pipeline run`): NO IMPACT
- Agent UI (`POST /api/v1/pipeline/run`): NO IMPACT
- Chat mode ("build me a pipeline"): Routes to CodeAgent

**Recommendation:** DEFER TO POST-MERGE P1

**Rationale:**
1. Pipeline orchestration is RESOLVED via `PipelineOrchestrator`
2. This is a design question (intent detection), not a bug fix
3. Lower-risk incremental approach: add keyword detection post-merge
4. Can document as known limitation

**Post-Merge Action:** Add intent detection for "pipeline", "orchestrate", "auto-spawn" keywords
