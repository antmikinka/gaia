# Final Merge Decision: feature/pipeline-orchestration-v1

**Date:** 2026-04-11 (updated from 2026-04-09)
**Decision Maker:** Software Program Manager + Recursive Agent Pipeline
**Branch:** feature/pipeline-orchestration-v1
**Target Branch:** main

---

## Executive Summary

**MERGE DECISION: APPROVED FOR MERGE**

The branch is ready for merge to main. All core pipeline functionality is implemented including CLI and Agent UI integration.
All Session-3 P1 items have been completed and quality-reviewed (quality_review_session3.md: PASS).
Remaining items are post-merge P1/P2 documentation cleanup or blocked on external PR #606 (requires rebase after PR #606 merges).

### Merge Recommendation Change (2026-04-11)
**Previous Status:** CONDITIONALLY APPROVED (pending Session-3 bug fixes)
**Current Status:** APPROVED FOR MERGE (all Session-3 bugs fixed, quality review PASS)

### What Changed Since Initial Approval (2026-04-09)
- **B3-C (Agent UI pipeline execution):** Implemented `POST /api/v1/pipeline/run` SSE endpoint
  in `src/gaia/ui/routers/pipeline.py` with session locks, semaphore, and StreamingResponse.
  Frontend types, API service, and Zustand store created.
- **Document coherence:** This MERGE_DECISION updated to reflect actual implementation state.
  Previously claimed "APPROVED" while B3-C was still planned but not executed.
- **Session-3 (2026-04-11):** 
  - **P1-1 (Resilience Wiring):** `RoutingEngine.route_defect_resilient()` implemented with circuit breaker, bulkhead, and retry primitives. Backward compatible: existing `route_defect()` unchanged. Quality review found 2 bugs (resilience stacking, PEP 8), both FIXED.
  - **P1-2 (Capability Migration):** Migration utility `util/migrate-capabilities.py` created and applied. 3 capability strings updated across 2 YAML files (`security-auditor.yaml`, `senior-developer.yaml`). Unified vocabulary defined in `docs/spec/unified-capability-model.md`.
  - **B3-C Bug Fixes:** SSE endpoint lock release logic simplified (removed `locks_released` tracking), JSON serialization error handling added to all streaming event paths. All 4 quality review bugs now FIXED.
- **Quality Review Session 3:** quality_review_session3.md updated from CONDITIONAL APPROVED to PASS.
- **Merge Recommendation:** Updated from CONDITIONALLY APPROVED to APPROVED FOR MERGE.

## Section 7: RoutingAgent Hardcoded Default — Strategic Assessment

**Item:** P0 decoupled to post-merge P1
**Assessment Date:** 2026-04-11
**Assessor:** Dr. Sarah Kim, Technical Product Strategist

### 7.1 Current State

The `RoutingAgent` at `src/gaia/agents/routing/agent.py:488` defaults to `agent_type = "code"` when no explicit agent match occurs. This routes natural-language pipeline requests in chat mode to `CodeAgent` instead of `PipelineOrchestrator`.

**Key Finding:** The `PipelineOrchestrator` (518 LOC, `src/gaia/pipeline/orchestrator.py`) successfully delivers five-stage orchestration with gap detection. Pipeline-level orchestration is RESOLVED.

### 7.2 Impact Analysis

| User Path | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| `gaia pipeline run` CLI | NO IMPACT |
| `POST /api/v1/pipeline/run` (Agent UI) | NO IMPACT (direct endpoint) |
| Chat: "build me a pipeline" | IMPACTED (routed to CodeAgent) |

### 7.3 Recommended Approach

**DO NOT fix before merge.** This is a design question, not a bug fix.

**Option A: Intent Detection (Lower Risk)**
- Add keyword/intent detection for "pipeline", "orchestrate", "auto-spawn"
- Route matching queries to `PipelineOrchestrator.execute_full_pipeline()`
- Preserves existing `CodeAgent` fallback for non-pipeline requests

**Option B: Capability-Based AgentOrchestrator (Higher Risk)**
- Create new `AgentOrchestrator` that queries `AgentRegistry` by capability
- Supersedes hardcoded `CodeAgent` default entirely
- Requires decisions about 18 legacy YAML agent configs

**Recommendation:** Pursue Option A post-merge. Lower blast radius, incremental improvement.

### 7.4 Mitigation

Add "Known Limitations" section to `docs/guides/auto-spawn-pipeline.mdx`:

```markdown
## Known Limitations

**Chat Mode Routing:** When using GAIA chat mode, pipeline requests may be routed to CodeAgent
instead of the pipeline orchestrator. Use the CLI command `gaia pipeline run` or the Agent UI
pipeline panel for reliable pipeline execution.
```

## Section 8: PR #606 Integration — Post-Merge Action Plan

**Status:** BLOCKED (requires PR #606 merge to main first)
**Estimated Effort:** 3.5 engineer-hours

### 8.1 HIGH-Severity Conflict Files

| File | Our Branch | PR #606 | Resolution |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| `_chat_helpers.py` | 1,144 lines | +38 lines | Absorb `_register_agent_memory_ops()` |
| `database.py` | 787 lines | +31/-3 | Absorb memory schema columns |
| `sse_handler.py` | 950 lines | +115/-1 | Absorb AgentLoop events |
| `routers/mcp.py` | 425 lines | +206/-1 | Merge both routers |

### 8.2 Pre-Rebase Coordination (P0)

Before PR #606 merges, coordinate with kovtcharov on:

1. **Q1:** Does `MemoryStore` share `gaia_chat.db` or use separate file? (Gates C-2)
2. **Q2:** Does `_register_agent_memory_ops()` access cache as `dict[str, ChatAgent]` or `dict[str, dict]`? (Gates C-1)
3. **Q3:** What is the AgentLoop SSE event JSON schema? (Gates C-3)
4. **Q4:** Interest in `AgentLoop`/`PipelineExecutor` convergence design session? (BU-3)
5. **Q5:** Authentication posture for MCP tool control endpoints? (Gates C-4)
6. **Q6:** Do memory eval scenarios use compatible runner? (Gates testing)

### 8.3 Rebase Steps (P1, Post-PR #606)

1. Rebase `feature/pipeline-orchestration-v1` onto updated main
2. Resolve C-1 through C-4 (HIGH severity first)
3. Resolve C-5 through C-10 (MEDIUM/LOW)
4. Run full test suite
5. Smoke test Agent UI
6. Verify CLI help output

See `docs/reference/pr606-integration-analysis.md` Section 9 for detailed steps.
