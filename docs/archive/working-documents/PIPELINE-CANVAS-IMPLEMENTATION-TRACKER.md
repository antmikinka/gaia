## Progress Log

### Session 2026-04-24

- Gap analysis completed using Clear Thought MCP sequential thinking (8 thoughts)
- Identified 6 major gaps across supervisor agents, loop blocks, conditionals, workspace UI, execution telemetry, and supervisor architecture
- Implementation tasks created: #34-#40
- Starting Tier 1 implementation: Supervisor Agent Integration

### Tier 1 Completion (2026-04-24)

**Types updated** (`src/gaia/apps/webui/src/types/index.ts`):
- Added `CanvasNodeType`: 'supervisor' | 'gate' | 'loop'
- Added `DecisionType`: CONTINUE | LOOP_BACK | PAUSE | COMPLETE | FAIL
- Added `GateCondition`: quality_below_threshold | error_detected | manual_review | iteration_limit
- Added `LoopConfig` interface
- Extended `CanvasNode` with decisionType, decisionCondition, gateCondition, branchTargets

**New components created**:
- `SupervisorNode.tsx` - Supervisor agent node with decision display, expandable config
- `DecisionGate.tsx` - Diamond-shaped gate with pass/fail branches, condition selector
- `LoopBlock.tsx` - Loop block with iteration counter, progress bar, near-limit warning

**Store updated** (`pipelineCanvasStore.ts`):
- Added `addSupervisorBetweenStages()`, `addGateBetweenStages()`, `addLoopBlock()` actions
- Enhanced `resetCanvas()` to include default supervisors and gates between stages
- Enhanced `applyExecutionState()` to handle quality scores, supervisor decisions, gate pass/fail

**Palette updated** (`AgentPalette.tsx`):
- Added "Pipeline Blocks" section with draggable Supervisor, Decision Gate, Loop Block

**StageZone updated** (`StageZone.tsx`):
- Renders SupervisorNode, DecisionGate, LoopBlock nodes per stage
- Handles drop of blockType from palette

**CSS updated** (`PipelineCanvas.css`):
- ~300+ lines of new styles for supervisor, gate, loop components
- Pipeline Blocks section styling in palette
- Pulse animation for near-limit loop blocks

**Canvas toolbar updated** (`PipelineCanvas.tsx`):
- Shows supervisor, gate, loop counts in toolbar stats
