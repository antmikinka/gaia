## Progress Log

### Session 2026-04-24

- Gap analysis completed using Clear Thought MCP sequential thinking (8 thoughts)
- Identified 6 major gaps across supervisor agents, loop blocks, conditionals, workspace UI, execution telemetry, and supervisor architecture
- Implementation tasks created: #34-#40
- Starting Tier 1 implementation: Supervisor Agent Integration

### Tier 1 & 2 Completion (2026-04-24)

**Commit:** `ef98904` - feat(ui): add supervisor agents, decision gates, loop blocks, and workspace tools

**Types updated** (`src/gaia/apps/webui/src/types/index.ts`):
- Added `CanvasNodeType`: 'supervisor' | 'gate' | 'loop'
- Added `DecisionType`: CONTINUE | LOOP_BACK | PAUSE | COMPLETE | FAIL
- Added `GateCondition`: quality_below_threshold | error_detected | manual_review | iteration_limit
- Added `LoopConfig` interface
- Extended `CanvasNode` with decisionType, decisionCondition, gateCondition, branchTargets

**New components created**:
- `SupervisorNode.tsx` - Supervisor agent node with decision display, expandable config
- `DecisionGate.tsx` - Diamond-shaped gate with pass/fail branches, condition selector
- `LoopBlock.tsx` - Loop block with iteration counter, progress bar, near-limit warning

**Store updated** (`pipelineCanvasStore.ts`):
- Added `addSupervisorBetweenStages()`, `addGateBetweenStages()`, `addLoopBlock()` actions
- Added Tier 2: `setZoom()`, `setPan()`, `resetView()`, `undo()`, `redo()`, `pushHistory()`
- Added Tier 2: `toggleNodeSelection()`, `clearSelection()`, `setShowGrid()`, `setSnapToGrid()`
- Enhanced `resetCanvas()` to include default supervisors and gates between stages
- Enhanced `applyExecutionState()` to handle quality scores, supervisor decisions, gate pass/fail

**Palette updated** (`AgentPalette.tsx`):
- Added "Pipeline Blocks" section with draggable Supervisor, Decision Gate, Loop Block

**StageZone updated** (`StageZone.tsx`):
- Renders SupervisorNode, DecisionGate, LoopBlock nodes per stage
- Handles drop of blockType from palette

**CSS updated** (`PipelineCanvas.css`):
- ~300+ lines of new styles for supervisor, gate, loop components
- Pipeline Blocks section styling in palette
- Pulse animation for near-limit loop blocks
- Grid background, zoom controls, active button states

**Canvas toolbar updated** (`PipelineCanvas.tsx`):
- Shows supervisor, gate, loop counts in toolbar stats
- Added undo/redo, zoom in/out, fit-to-view, grid toggle buttons
- Added wheel zoom and click-drag pan handlers
- Added transform wrapper for zoom/pan

### Tier 3: Execution Replay & History (2026-04-24)

**Backend** (`src/gaia/ui/routers/pipeline.py`):
- Added `_execution_history` in-memory list (max 100 runs)
- Added `record_execution()` helper to record pipeline runs with status, duration, quality scores, loop count, decisions, agents used
- Added `_execute_and_record()` wrapper that wraps both streaming and sync execution paths
- `GET /api/v1/pipeline/executions` - Paginated list of past executions
- `GET /api/v1/pipeline/executions/{pipeline_id}` - Execution detail
- `DELETE /api/v1/pipeline/executions/{pipeline_id}` - Delete execution
- `POST /api/v1/pipeline/executions/{pipeline_id}/replay` - Get replay config
- `GET /api/v1/pipeline/templates/{template_name}/versions` - List template versions
- `POST /api/v1/pipeline/templates/{template_name}/version` - Create template version snapshot

**Frontend** (`src/gaia/apps/webui/src/components/pipeline/ExecutionHistory.tsx`):
- Lists past executions with status icons, task description, duration, quality scores, loop count
- Expandable detail rows showing pipeline ID, session, quality scores, agents used
- Replay button pre-fills task description and switches to runner tab
- Delete button removes execution from history
- Refresh button reloads history from API

**Integration** (`PipelineRunner.tsx`):
- Added "History" tab alongside Canvas and Log View
- ExecutionHistory component wired with replay callback
- CSS for history tab content area
