## Section 1 — Architecture Overview

The system is a 4-layer stack. Layer 1 (`src/gaia/metrics/`) defines the core storage and analysis primitives: `MetricType` (14-value enum), `MetricSnapshot` (frozen dataclass), `MetricsCollector` (thread-safe, SQLite-backed), `MetricsAnalyzer` (trend + anomaly detection), and `MetricsReport`. Layer 2 (`src/gaia/pipeline/`) wraps Layer 1 in a `PipelineMetricsCollector` and 7 hook classes that fire automatically at phase boundaries, loop boundaries, quality evaluation points, agent selection events, and hook execution events. Layer 3 (`src/gaia/metrics/production_monitor.py`, `benchmarks.py`) provides `ProductionMonitor` (async polling, 2 alert types) and `PipelineBenchmarker` (6 benchmark types). Layer 4 (`src/gaia/quality/`) implements `QualityScorer` over 27 categories in 6 dimensions with 5 certification levels.

All metrics flow through `MetricsCollector.record_*()` methods, which write `MetricSnapshot` rows to SQLite. The pipeline layer calls these methods automatically via hooks; application code never calls `record_*` directly for pipeline events.

       → MetricsCollector.record_throughput()        [PM-07, if tokens > 0]
       → MetricsCollector.record_ttft()              [PM-08, if TTFT set]
  → LoopStartMetricsHook  → record LOOP_ITERATION_COUNT  [PM-10]
  → AgentSelectMetricsHook → record AGENT_SELECTION      [PM-13]
  → HookExecutionMetricsHook → record HOOK_EXECUTION_TIME [PM-11]
```

## Section 4 — Production Health Monitoring

### 4.1 — Alert Rules (`ProductionMonitor`)

Source: `src/gaia/metrics/production_monitor.py`. Both alerts emit at level WARNING.

| ID          | Name              | Trigger condition                                        | Default threshold         |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| PM-ALERT-01 | Low Success Rate  | `loops_executed > 0 AND success_rate < 0.99`            | 0.99 (strict less-than)   |
| PM-ALERT-02 | Error Count       | `len(errors) > 10`                                       | 10 (> 10 triggers; 11 fires) |

**Note:** PM-ALERT-01 is suppressed when `loops_executed == 0`; `success_rate` returns 1.0 for idle systems. Reference: `production_monitor.py:56-58`.

### 4.2 — Real-Time Aggregate Metrics (`ProductionMonitor` fields)

| Name             | Definition                                   | Formula                                        | Source                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `success_rate`   | Fraction of executed loops that succeeded    | `loops_successful / loops_executed` (property) | —                          |
| `avg_latency_ms` | Mean loop latency across all executed loops  | `total_latency_ms / loops_executed`            | —                          |
| `peak_memory_mb` | Maximum observed memory across all loops     | Settable field; caller updates on each loop    | —                          |
| `loops_failed`   | Count of loops that failed                   | Direct counter                                 | `production_monitor.py:41` |

### 4.3 — Health Bands (`MetricsReport.overall_health`)

| Status              | Condition               |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| `excellent`         | score ≥ 0.95            |
| `good`              | score ≥ 0.85            |
| `acceptable`        | score ≥ 0.70            |
| `needs_improvement` | score ≥ 0.50            |
| `critical`          | score < 0.50            |

## Section 5 — Analyzer Risk Scoring (`MetricsAnalyzer.risk_level`)

Source: `src/gaia/metrics/` — `MetricsAnalyzer`.

**Score accumulation rules:**

| Event                                          | Points added |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Negative trend AND trend confidence > 0.70     | +1           |
| High anomaly detected                          | +2           |
| Critical anomaly detected                      | +3           |

**Risk level mapping (cumulative score):**

| Risk level | Score condition |
|------------|-----------------|
| `minimal`  | score = 0       |
| `low`      | score ≥ 1       |
| `medium`   | score ≥ 2       |
| `high`     | score ≥ 5       |

**Note:** `low` (abs_z: 2.0–2.49) and `medium` (abs_z: 2.5–2.99) anomalies are detected and reported but contribute 0 to the risk score. Reference: `analyzer.py:604-612`.

## Section 6 — Benchmark Suite (BF-01 – BF-06)

Source: `src/gaia/metrics/benchmarks.py` — `PipelineBenchmarker`.

| ID    | Type             | Purpose                                | Target                       | Bottleneck / fail condition                        |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| BF-01 | LATENCY          | p50/p95/p99 latency distribution       | median < 15,000 ms           | `avg_latency_ms > 15,000`                          |
| BF-02 | THROUGHPUT       | Concurrent execution rate              | > 1,000 loops/hr             | `throughput < 1,000/hr`                            |
| BF-03 | MEMORY           | Peak memory consumption                | < 500 MB                     | `avg_memory > 500 MB`                              |
| BF-04 | TOKEN_EFFICIENCY | Token budget per feature               | < 10,000 tokens/feature      | No explicit bottleneck flag; feeds PM-01           |
| BF-05 | SCALE            | Scaling linearity under load increase  | Time grows linearly          | `time_factor > scale_factor × 1.5`                 |
| BF-06 | ENDURANCE        | Memory leak detection over time        | No sustained memory growth   | `growth > 20% AND increase > 5 MB`                 |

## Section 7 — Quality Scorer

Source: `src/gaia/quality/` — `QualityScorer`, `CertificationStatus`.

### 7.1 — Certification Thresholds

| Status              | Overall score | `passed` flag |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| `EXCELLENT`         | ≥ 95          | True          |
| `GOOD`              | ≥ 85          | True          |
| `ACCEPTABLE`        | ≥ 75          | True          |
| `NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT` | ≥ 65          | False         |
| `FAIL`              | < 65          | False         |

Per-category floor: every individual category raw_score must be ≥ 70 to avoid flagging.

### 7.2 — Dimension Weights (Profile: `balanced`)

| Dimension               | Weight           | Category count    |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `code_quality`          | 25%              | 7 (CQ-01–CQ-07)   |
| `requirements_coverage` | 25%              | 4 (RC-01–RC-04)   |
| `testing`               | 20%              | 4 (TS-01–TS-04)   |
| `documentation`         | 15%              | 4 (DC-01–DC-04)   |
| `best_practices`        | 15%              | 5 (BP-01–BP-05)   |
| `additional`            | 7% (hardcoded)   | 3 (AC-01–AC-03)   |

**Note:** The dimension key in `QualityScorer.CATEGORIES` is `"requirements"`. The `balanced` profile in `weight_config.py` uses the key `"requirements_coverage"`. Both refer to the same dimension.

**Note:** The `additional` dimension is not present in the `balanced` profile; its three categories use hardcoded weights (AC-01: 3%, AC-02: 2%, AC-03: 2%).

### 7.3 — All 27 Quality Categories

## Section 9 — Known Gaps

Items tracked here are not implemented as of branch `feature/pipeline-orchestration-v1`.

| Gap ID     | Affected KPI                          | Description                                                                                         | Priority |
|------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| GAP-PM-01  | PM-14 RESOURCE_UTILIZATION            | No alert threshold or pass/fail rule defined for resource utilization; metric is recorded but silent.| P0       |
| GAP-PM-02  | PM-12 STATE_TRANSITION                | No pass/fail rule; events are logged as timestamps only; no SLA or anomaly detection on transitions.| P1       |
| GAP-PM-03  | PM-13 AGENT_SELECTION                 | No pass/fail rule; counts selection events only; no threshold for excessive re-routing.             | P1       |
| GAP-PM-04  | PM-ALERT-03 (missing)                 | No latency SLA alert in `ProductionMonitor`; `avg_latency_ms` is tracked but never triggers a warning. | P0   |
| GAP-PM-05  | BF-04 TOKEN_EFFICIENCY bottleneck     | `PipelineBenchmarker` records token budget results but defines no bottleneck condition flag for BF-04. | P2    |
